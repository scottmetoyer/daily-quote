Simple python script that updates wallpaper with a random quote each time it's run. Also includes a quote server written in node.js that feeds up random quotes.

Usage:

Start the quote server by running

    node quoteserver.js
    
Run the wallpaper script by running

    update-wallpaper.py
    
You need node.js, python 2.7, and PIL 1.1.7. Everything was written and tested only on Windows.
